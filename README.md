# JavaScript Testing

A project for practicing with the [Jest]() testing framework for JavaScript
applications.

## Files tested

Everything under the `src` folder.

- `array_analysis.js`
- `caesar.js`
- `calculator.js`
- `capitalize.js`
- `reverse_string.js`

## How to run the tests?

The npm task `npm test` will trigger the command `npx jest --watch test/*`, this
will put your terminal in a watching mode (will listen for file changes and
run the tests again if a change happens).
